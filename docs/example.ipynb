By presenting data in a user-friendly format, `show_all` not only saves time but also ensures compatibility with other functions in the workflow, like `display_best_score` and `select_model`. It's efficient way to begin the model evaluation process, setting the stage for more detailed analysis.\n",

The tabular presentation enhances readability, simplifies the process of identifying specific model scores, and contributes to a streamlined model evaluation workflow. Consider a real-life application like using the load_diabetes dataset from sklearn. A researcher can train multiple models to predict diabetes progression and then use `show_all` to access a user friendly view of all the models and their respective metrics. \n",

This is especially useful in situations where a multitude of models have been trained and evaluated, and there's a need to drill down into the specifics of one model without getting overwhelmed by the broader data."
