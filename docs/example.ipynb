    "In critical sectors like healthcare, the choice of an accurate and efficient predictive model is crucial, impacting decision-making and outcomes significantly. The `autopredictor` package is designed to simplify and expedite the process of model selection and evaluation for continuous data scenarios. This package is especially valuable for healthcare professionals, data scientists, and researchers, offering them more time for insightful data interpretation and strategic decision-making. This tutorial will demonstrate the use of autopredictor with a diabetes dataset, reflecting real-world health data scenarios."

    "### Handling Continuous and Categorical Responses\n",
    "The `autopredictor` package is optimized for continuous response variables, ideal for regression tasks where the outcome is a continuous value. While it can process categorical features within the input data, the response variable (y) should be continuous. This makes the package particularly suitable for scenarios like predicting numerical outcomes in healthcare or finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression Models\n",
    "The `autopredictor` package includes a collection of regression models, each suited for different types of datasets and analysis requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Regression:**\n",
    "  - A statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.\n",
    "  - Assumes a linear relationship between inputs and the target output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Regression (L1 Regularization):**\n",
    "  - A variant of linear regression that includes L1 regularization, which adds a penalty equivalent to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients.\n",
    "  - Helps in feature selection by shrinking coefficients of less important features to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Regression (L2 Regularization):**\n",
    "  - Similar to L1, but uses L2 regularization where the penalty is the square of the magnitude of coefficients.\n",
    "  - Tends to distribute error among all the terms, useful in avoiding overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM):**\n",
    "  - A type of SVM that's used for regression tasks. It tries to find a line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that best fits the data.\n",
    "  - Effective in high-dimensional spaces and best suited for cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Support Vector Machine:**\n",
    "  - An extension of Linear SVM, capable of performing both linear and non-linear regression.\n",
    "  - Utilizes kernel functions to transform data into a higher dimension where a hyperplane can be used to perform the regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decision Tree:**\n",
    "  - A tree-like model of decisions where each node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf represents an outcome.\n",
    "  - Simple to understand and interpret, and can handle both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Forest:**\n",
    "  - An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training.\n",
    "  - For regression tasks, it takes the average prediction of the individual trees, which usually results in better performance and less overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gradient Boosting:**\n",
    "  - An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, with each new model being trained to correct the errors made by the previous ones.\n",
    "  - Combines weak predictive models to create a strong model, particularly effective for complex datasets with nonlinear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AdaBoost:**\n",
    "  - Short for Adaptive Boosting, it combines multiple weak learners to increase the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "  - Adjusts the weights of incorrectly classified instances so that subsequent classifiers focus more on difficult cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these models offers unique advantages and can be selected based on the specific requirements of your dataset and prediction task. Understanding the underlying mechanics of these models will help you make informed decisions when using the `autopredictor` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scoring Metrics\n",
    "The `autopredictor` package features a diverse array of scoring metrics, tailored to evaluate the performance of regression models across various datasets and analytical needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** This is the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values. A lower MAE value indicates a model with fewer errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):** It measures the average percentage error between the predicted and actual values. Like MAE, a lower MAPE value signifies better model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **R-squared (R2):** This metric quantifies the percentage of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. A higher R2 value (closer to 1) indicates a better model fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** MSE calculates the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. A lower MSE value is preferable, indicating higher precision of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** RMSE is the square root of MSE and provides a measure of the magnitude of the error. Like MSE, a lower RMSE indicates a more accurate model."

    "__Input Type Check:__ Similar to `display_best_score`, before employing the `select_model` function, ensure that the input result is a DataFrame. Passing any other data type will raise a `TypeError`.\n",

    "__Empty DataFrame:__ Make sure that the DataFrame provided contains at least one model and its respective scoring metrics. Attempting to use an empty DataFrame will result in a `TypeError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `select_model` function is not only beneficial for focusing on a specific model's performance but also serves as a useful tool for verifying the presence of a model within the dataset. When an analyst specifies a model, the function checks if that model is included in the DataFrame's index. If the model is not found, the function doesn't just stop at returning an error message; it goes a step further by providing a list of the models that are included. This feature is particularly helpful in multiple ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Model Inventory Check:__ It essentially acts as a quick inventory check, allowing users to confirm which models have been trained and evaluated. This is especially useful in collaborative environments where multiple team members might be working on the same dataset but focusing on different models. It ensures that everyone is aware of the models that are already included in the analysis, helping to avoid redundant work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Informed Decision Making:__ By providing a list of available models, it aids in informed decision-making. Analysts can quickly scan through the available models and decide which ones to focus on based on their specific criteria or hypothesis, without having to look through the entire DataFrame."
