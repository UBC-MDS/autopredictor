    "## Visualizing model scores in a table format\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing the `fit` function, both the training and testing scores are available in a dictionary format. The `show_all` function is a versatile tool for efficiently visualize the regression model scores. It transforms the raw model scores into a structured DataFrame and ensure compatibility with subsequent functions such as `display_best` and `select_model` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By converting the dictionary into an organized format and sorting the results alphabetically by model name, `show_all` offers a quick and efficient mean of comprehending and comparing regression model performance. The tabular presentation enhances readability, simplifies the process of identifying specific model scores, and contributes to a streamlined model evaluation workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's possible to achieve similar conversions using pandas manipulation, `show_all` is purpose-built for this package, ensuring the validity of scoring metrics in the dictionary.\n"

    "\n",
    "To ensure a smooth and error-free experience, it is crucial to be mindful of certain considerations during its usage. Here are some troubleshooting tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Type Check:__ The `show_all` function expects the input `result` to be a dictionary. Passing a non-dictionary type would result in a `TypeError`.\n",
    "2. __Empty Dictionary:__ Ensure that the input argument contains scores for at least one model. Passing an empty dictionary would result in a `ValueError`.\n",
    "3. __Valid Scoring Metrics:__ This function expects dictionary scores outputted from the `fit` function. It ensures that the scoring metrics are valid and complete. Passing an invalid scoring metrics as the dictionary's value will result in a `ValueError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adhering to these guidelines, you can maximize the utility of the `show_all` function while preventing potential errors in its usage."
