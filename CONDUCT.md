# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

Welcome to AutoPredictor! We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive space for everyone. We aim to maintain a safe, respectful community free from harassment. We invite people from all backgrounds, irrespective of age, body size, disabilities, ethnicity, gender, experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, physical appearance, race, caste, color, religion, sexual identity, and orientation, to join our community and get involved with our project. We believe that diversity fosters innovation, and we appreciate the unique contributions of each member of our community.

## Our Standards

Our community is committed to creating a welcoming environment. This commitment includes, but is not limited to, the following key principles:

-   Respectful Interaction: We encourage a culture of polite and constructive dialogue. Value diverse perspectives and practice empathy and compassion.

-   Community Consciousness: Prioritize the community's collective well-being over individual interests. Report any unsafe situations or breaches of the Code of Conduct.

-   Collaboration: Foster teamwork and knowledge sharing. Remain open to new ideas and welcome helpful feedback.

-   Accountability: Take responsibility for your actions, apologize to those impacted by your errors, and learn from these incidents.

-   Inclusion: Aid in creating a space where everyone feels included, using language that is friendly and supportive of people from different backgrounds.

-   Professionalism: Uphold a high standard of professionalism, respecting various views and experiences. Be honest and open in your interactions.

Our community strictly prohibits any behavior that is threatening, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, belittling, or demeaning. This prohibition extends to, but is not limited to, the following:

-   Using sexual language or imagery, or making unwelcome sexual advancements.

-   Engaging in trolling, personal or politically motivated attacks.

-   Participating in public or private harassment.

-   Revealing someone's confidential information without their consent.

We have a zero-tolerance stance on any conduct considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Consequences for Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior will not be allowed and will result in immediate corrective measures. These include:

-   Formal Warning: An official written notification and a meeting to discuss the behavior. This might be a confidential warning or result in a public statement.

-   Temporary Suspension: A short-term ban from engaging in the project or communicating with the community may be implemented.

-   Permanent Exclusion: A permanent ban on participation in the project and community interactions will be implemented. This measure is more likely to be implemented in the event of repeated unacceptable behavior.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clearly stating and maintaining the expected norms of behavior. Community leaders should also act appropriately when dealing with unacceptable behavior.

Community leaders must remove, change, or reject comments, code contributions, issues, and other inputs that don't follow the Code of Conduct. They will provide explanations about these actions and decisions when and if appropriate.

## Scope

This set of behavioral guidelines applies to everyone associated with our project and is valid in all related areas, including public places where our community members represent us. This includes leaders, contributors, maintainers, and users. All participants must adhere to these guidelines while using official channels of communication for the project, like emails and social media, and when representing the project at events, whether virtual or in-person.

## Enforcement

In the event that you witness or experience any harmful, harassing, or inappropriate conduct, we encourage you to contact our team at [zeilygar\@student.ubc.ca](mailto:zeilygar@student.ubc.ca). We prioritize every complaint and ensure a thorough response from our community leaders. The current community leaders responsible for managing these reports are Anu Banga, Arturo Rey, Sharon Voon, and Zeily Garcia. Upon examination, leaders will implement appropriate measures. The identity of anyone reporting an incident will always be kept confidential.

The responsibility of enforcing this Code of Conduct fairly lies with the project maintainers. If any community leader fails to meet these standards, the other leaders can enact temporary or permanent actions against them. This policy is in place to ensure that our community is a secure and respectful environment for everyone.
